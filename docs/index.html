        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>Mr. A has 4 ways to commute to work: car, bus, train, and boat.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If Mr. A drives himself, there is a 30% chance of being late for work.</li>
        <li>If Mr. A takes the bus, there is a 50% chance of being late for work.</li>
        <li>If Mr. A takes the train, there is a 6% chance of being late for work.</li>
        <li>If Mr. A takes the boat, there is a 10% chance of being late for work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One day, Mr. A arrives late for work. His boss wants to know:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What is the probability that Mr. A drove to work?</li>
        <li>What is the probability that Mr. A took the train to work?</li>
        <li>What is the probability that Mr. A took the boat to work?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The boss considers all of Mr. A's commuting options equally likely.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="answer">
        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>We will calculate the probability for each commute option using the provided equation.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Car</h3>
            <p>Equation: (0.3 * (1/4)) / ((0.3 * (1/4)) + (0.5 * (1/4)) + (0.06 * (1/4)) + (0.1 * (1/4)))</p>
            <p>Answer: 0.3125</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Bus</h3>
            <p>Equation: (0.5 * (1/4)) / ((0.3 * (1/4)) + (0.5 * (1/4)) + (0.06 * (1/4)) + (0.1 * (1/4)))</p>
            <p>Answer: 0.5208</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Train</h3>
            <p>Equation: (0.06 * (1/4)) / ((0.3 * (1/4)) + (0.5 * (1/4)) + (0.06 * (1/4)) + (0.1 * (1/4)))</p>
            <p>Answer: 0.0625</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Boat</h3>
            <p>Equation: (0.1 * (1/4)) / ((0.3 * (1/4)) + (0.5 * (1/4)) + (0.06 * (1/4)) + (0.1 * (1/4)))</p>
